"raspberrygpiotemp" - module for extracting temperature readings from a 1-wire
                      network attached directly to Raspberry Pi's GPIOTEMP

    network.

    supported properties:

      "device_id"  - type string, the name of the device from the /dev
                     filesystem: /sys/bus/w1/devices/<device_id>/w1_slave

    generated events: The event generated by this plugin will have the following
    format:

      "reading" - type double, temperature reading
      "units" - "C"
      "units_humanized" - "Celsius"

    The directory structure is as following:

      cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
      cd 10-000801b5*
      cat w1_slave
      0f 00 4b 46 ff ff 06 10 0c : crc=0c YES
      0f 00 4b 46 ff ff 06 10 0c t=7375


"scenectl" - plugin for activating scenes (set of sensors to be controlled
    simultaneously)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    supported properties:

      "scene" - type ShpScene, scene to be activated

    trigger events: This plugin is listening for events of the following kind:

      <empty>

"telldus" - module for emitting radio frequency signals and thus turning
            wall-plug sockets on and off using Tellstick
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Look at telldus.txt for info on how to install Telldus stick

    supported properties:

      "device-id" - type integer, device id from the /etc/tellstick.conf conf
                    file

    generated events: The event generated by this plugin will have the following
    format:

      "status" - type string, value "on" or "off"

    trigger events: This plugin is listening for events of the following kind:

      "command" - type string, value "on" or "off"

    If command is not present, the device will be switched from on to off or
    vice-versa.

"timer" - module for generating time events(normally every second)
------------------------------------------------------------------

    generated events: The event generated by this plugin will have the following
    format:

      "hour" - type integer
      "minutes" - type integer
      "seconds" - type integer
      "year" - type integer
      "month" - type integer
      "day" - type integer
      "week_day" - type integer

"grovedust" - measuring the dust concentration with the Grove Dust sensor
              (Shinyei PPD42NS) connected to Raspberry Pi
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    supported properties:

      "pin" - type integer, pin number the dust sensor is connected to

    generated events: The event generated by this plugin will have the following
    format:

      "aqi" - type integer, Air Quality index
      "ugm3" - type double
      "pcs" - type double

"rest" - providing REST API for managing devices remotely
---------------------------------------------------------

    supported properties:

      "port" - type integer, Port to listen on for new connections, default is
               8080
      "config-file" - path incl. name for the configure file describing how
                      plugin data is supposed to be visualised on the web.

    supported signals:

      "add-device-path" - add path to listen on for sensor data
                          The application setting up the plugin can emit the
                          signal multiple times and thus adding multiple paths.

                          Example: Lets say that we have 3 main groups of devices:
                          /home/floor1/
                          /home/floor2/
                          /home/floor3/

                          by emitting the signal twice, once for /home/floor1/
                          and another time for /home/floor3/, all devices on the
                          1st and the 3rd floor will be exposed externally on
                          the REST API, however devices on the 2nd floor will
                          not be showed.

    Config file must be in the following format:

    >cat homefrog-rest.conf

    ds1820digitemp:sensor-simple:temperature double:units string
    telldus:switch-simple:status string
    scenectl:scene:
    grovedust:sensor-simple:aqi integer:aqi_scale string

    <plugin name>:<device-class>:<option 1> <option 1 type>:...
